# _Containered ROS2 Development Environment_

## Method1: Dev Container in vscode with GUI passthrough (Tested on x86-64 Ubuntu 22.04)
This sets up ROS2 Dev Container with Rviz2, Ignition Gazebo, Moveit2, Nav2, SLAM Toolbox and other dependencies.

### Setup Instructions

1. Install Dev Container VSCode extension and Remote Development Extension pack

2. Clone the repository.

3. VSCode should ask you to reopen the directory in dev container. Or you can invoke `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` from command panel in VSCode.

4. You will need to source ROS2 using by running `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` for now.

5. Any GUI application can then directly be run using the terminal.
 
## Method2: Development Container for ROS 2 via RDP (Tested on x86-64 Ubuntu 22.04 and arm64 M2 Mac)

### Recommended RDP Clients

- **Windows App**:
  It supports sound playback. Use the host system's username and password.

These steps will guide you through setting up and using a ROS 2 Docker container on your x86-64 or arm64-based Ubuntu or Mac device, including desktop access through RDP.
